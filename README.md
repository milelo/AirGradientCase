# AirGradient-diy laser cut case
A Freecad design for a laser cut case for the [AirGradient-diy](https://www.airgradient.com/diy/) air quality monitor.

Note: As there is no thermal isolation from the heat given out by the particulate sensor this is not recommended for use with an internal temperature and humidity sensor.
