# AirGradient-diy laser cut case
A Freecad, laser-cut case design for the [AirGradient-diy](https://www.airgradient.com/diy/) air quality monitor.

Notes:
1. As there is no thermal isolation from the heat given out by the particulate sensor this is not recommended for use with an internal temperature and humidity sensor.
1. The positioning of the USB port cut-out assumes the Wemos D1 Mini is soldered directly to the PCB with its USB connector in contact with the PCB.
1. The 2.5mm diameter holes need to be threaded with an M3, 0.5mm pitch, taper tap, for the nylon screws.
